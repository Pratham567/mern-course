    <!-- 
        follow the syntax:
        selector {
            property: value;
        }

        Eg:
        h1 {
            color: darkslateblue;
        }

        selector can be: element, class, id
        An element can have only 1 ID, but can have multiple classes.
        class selector is denoted by a dot (.)
        id selector is denoted by a hash (#)
        element selector is denoted by the element name

        The ID should be unique for the whole HTML app.
